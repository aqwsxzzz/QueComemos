# Code Structure — Responsibility & Abstraction

Two complementary disciplines decide how code is shaped. They pull in opposite directions, and good structure is the balance between them:

- **Single Responsibility (SRP)** — *when to split*. One unit, one job, one reason to change.
- **Avoid Hasty Abstractions (AHA)** — *when not to extract*. Duplication is cheap; the wrong abstraction is expensive.

The synthesis: **split on responsibility, never on shape or line count alone.** SRP tells you to separate two jobs that happen to sit in one file; AHA tells you not to merge two blocks that merely look alike.

## Quick Reference — When to Load What

| Working on… | Read |
|---|---|
| Splitting a file/function/class, separating concerns, file size | SINGLE-RESPONSIBILITY.md |
| Tempted to extract a helper/base class/utility from duplicated code | AVOID-ABSTRACTIONS.md |

## Hard Limits

Concrete, enforceable thresholds. Crossing one is a signal to split — not an automatic split, but a prompt to check for a second responsibility.

| Metric | Max | Action |
|--------|-----|--------|
| File length | 200 lines | Split into smaller modules |
| Function/method body | 30 lines | Extract helpers |
| Function parameters | 3 | Use an options/config object |
| Nesting depth | 3 levels | Early returns or extracted helpers |
| Cyclomatic complexity | 5 branches | Simplify or split |
| Class dependencies | 5 imports | The class knows too much — split |

## The Split Test (SRP)

Describe the unit in one sentence. If you need **"and"**, it has more than one responsibility.

```
"fetches the orders"                              → one job
"fetches the orders AND formats them for export"  → two jobs — split
```

A unit has **one reason to change** when it serves one actor. If the business team and the ops team would both edit the same file for unrelated reasons, that file has two responsibilities. See SINGLE-RESPONSIBILITY.md for separation of concerns (computation vs side effects, query vs command, policy vs mechanism).

## The Extraction Test (AHA)

Similar-looking code is **not** a reason to extract. Before pulling out a shared helper, all of these must hold:

1. The pattern appears **3+ times** with *identical intent* — not just identical shape.
2. You can name it for **what** it does, not **how** (`calculateTax`, not `processWithFlags`).
3. **No caller needs a boolean or mode parameter** to bend it to their case.
4. All callers would break together, for the same reason, if the logic were wrong.

```python
# BAD: extracted on shape — a flag now leaks caller-specific behavior
def send(user, kind):
    if kind == "welcome": ...
    elif kind == "reset": ...

# GOOD: two purpose-named functions; duplication is a vocabulary, not debt
def send_welcome(user): ...
def send_password_reset(user): ...
```

**Every boolean parameter hides two functions in a trench coat.** If extraction needs a flag, you found two functions, not one abstraction. See AVOID-ABSTRACTIONS.md for the failure pattern and how to undo a wrong abstraction.

## When NOT to Split

The two forces meet here. Keep code together when:

- Two things **always change together** and serve the same actor (verify with `git log`, not vibes).
- Splitting would add indirection with no testability gain.
- The unit is under ~30 lines and reads clearly as-is.
- Code is merely *coincidentally* similar — same shape, different intent. Leave it duplicated.

## Rules

1. **Describe a unit in one sentence without "and"** — if you can't, it has two jobs; split it.
2. **Separate computation from side effects**, and queries from commands (CQS).
3. **Never exceed 200 lines/file or 30 lines/function** — split before crossing, not after.
4. **Never nest deeper than 3 levels** — use early returns.
5. **Never mix levels of abstraction** in one function.
6. **Never extract on the second duplication** — wait for the third, and only if intent (not just shape) matches.
7. **Never add a boolean/mode parameter** to make a shared helper fit a new caller — split into purpose-named functions.
8. **Never extract a helper used in exactly one place.**
9. **Split on responsibility, never on line count or visual similarity alone.**
10. **Inline a wrong abstraction** before trying to "fix" it with more parameters.
11. **Don't over-split** — only split when there is a real second responsibility.

## Reference Files

- **SINGLE-RESPONSIBILITY.md** — read when deciding how to split a file, function, class, or module. Covers the hard-limit thresholds, separation of concerns (computation vs side effects, query vs command, policy vs mechanism), one-resource-per-class, levels of abstraction, early returns, pipeline-over-monolith, file organization, the SRP smell tests, and when *not* to split.
- **AVOID-ABSTRACTIONS.md** — read when tempted to extract a helper, base class, or shared utility from duplicated code. Covers the Rule of Three, the boolean-flag failure pattern, BAD/GOOD pairs (mode flags, inheritance misuse, single-use helpers, over-generic utilities), shape vs intent, when extraction *is* correct, and how to undo a wrong abstraction.
